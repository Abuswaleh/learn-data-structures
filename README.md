### Note from the author

Hi,

I'm Hardik Khandelwal currently working as a Software Engineer at Google (Ex Amazon).

I've started this repository as a running resource to be used by anyone starting their data structures journey.

As a hobby, I'm also a data structures and algorithms (DSA) instructor at Newton school. I teach students with no background in DSA the intricacies involved in problem-solving and making them ready for placements in tech companies.

While a portion of this repository will host assignment questions and in-class problems taken during my sessions at NewtonSchool. A large portion of it would be an open source where I'll take Leetcode problems with their explanations.

I plan to structure this entire repository so that it can be followed chronologically by anyone who is an absolute beginner to DSA and we should iteratively move towards solving complex interview-oriented problems.


I hope this repository helps!

Cheers!

Hardik
